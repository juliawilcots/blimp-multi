The following samples have external SD > 0.05 and cycles with 1-10 cap 47 values > 3 SD outside of the mean. 
These cycles need to be disabled in Easotope (Screens > Data Input > Your name > Your project). 
If disabling these cycles does not lower cap 47 WG RAW SD to < 0.05, disable the replicate, and write a note explaining why.
